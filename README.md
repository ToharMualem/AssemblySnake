# AssemblySnake
An assembly 86x snake game I developed as a high school project.
# How to execute ?
I used GUI Turbo Assembler (an assembly IDE, TASM and TLINK) for compiling, linking and eventually running the snake.asm code.
Ofcourse you can use other assemblers
# Gameplay
Use WASD keys for changing snake's direction, snake grows after colliding an apple ("eating"), colliding the walls will terminate the program.
Unfortunately, the game doesn't count score while playing, the core of the game is the visual output and getting input from keyboard.

Enjoy!
